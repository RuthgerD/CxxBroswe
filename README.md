## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

Our system provides a tool for C++ language lawyers, extending the usability of [https://eel.is/c++draft/](https://eel.is/c++draft/) (statically generated by [Eelis/cxxdraft-htmlgen](https://github.com/Eelis/cxxdraft-htmlgen)), by adding a few features that are often needed by people digging into the standard or planning to publish proposals.

The defined features are:
- *Time-machine*: being able to look at the last draft before any published ISO C++ version, as well as any individual git commit of [the draft repository](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft)
- *Proposals*: a proposal author can provide their wording diff to the application, and then browse the draft with their diff applied to it (albeit highlighted in e.g. orange), as well as share a link to that altered draft preview; proposals should be revisable by their respective author(s), and users should be able to browse through public proposals. Users should be able to aggregate multiple proposals into the same draft preview, unless they have diff clashes.
- *PR Mirror*: any PR to [the draft repository](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft) should have its diff be trivially considered for input (eg., a special link with the PR number in it leads to the draft preview with the modifications applied)
- *Search*: `Ctrl+F`, but across the entire wording, possibly across multiple draft versions
- *WhenWasThatAdded*: get the git blame of any paragraph


### Pages

- **Preview**: the main page, displaying the currently selected preview (latest draft git HEAD by default); has foldable tools for all the above features
- **Proposals Repository**: a searchable list of all the publicly published proposals on the app
- **Proposal Differ**: the place where users can create, edit, delete or publish proposal diffs.
